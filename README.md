The tutorial includes several checkpoints:

* [App generated by Sencha Cmd][0]
* [Demo application showing default Pictos icons][1]
* [Add the 'anchor' icon to the theme][2]
* [Add all icons from Pictos font to the theme][3]
* [Add 3 custom icons from IcoMoon font to theme][4]

## Using this repository to follow the screencast

First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senchalearn/IconViewer.git

Change into the directory:

    cd IconViewer

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 0_cmd_generated_app origin/0_cmd_generated_app
    git checkout -b 1_default_icons origin/1_default_icons
    git checkout -b 2_include_anchor_icon origin/2_include_anchor_icon
    git checkout -b 3_include_all_pictos_icons origin/3_include_all_pictos_icons
    git checkout -b 4_add_custom_icons origin/4_add_custom_icons
